# Temporal Logic of Actions (TLA+) Demo

A practical introduction to formal verification using TLA+ through a file upload idempotency problem.

## What is TLA+?

TLA+ (Temporal Logic of Actions) is a formal specification language for modeling and verifying concurrent and distributed systems. It helps you:

- **Model system behavior** precisely using mathematical logic
- **Find bugs** before implementation through exhaustive state exploration
- **Verify correctness** properties like safety and liveness
- **Document assumptions** and invariants clearly

TLA+ is particularly powerful for systems where race conditions, edge cases, and complex state interactions can cause subtle bugs.

## The Problem: Upload Idempotency

This demo models a common issue: ensuring file uploads are idempotent (safe to retry). We compare two approaches:

1. **Buggy**: Random UUID keys ‚Üí duplicates on retry
2. **Fixed**: Content-addressed keys ‚Üí idempotent uploads

## Installing TLA+

### Option 1: VS Code Extension (Recommended)
1. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [TLA+ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alygin.vscode-tlaplus)
3. The extension includes TLC model checker and PlusCal translator

### Option 2: Standalone TLA+ Toolbox
1. Download from [TLA+ official site](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html)
2. Extract and run the toolbox application
3. Import specifications as new projects

### Option 3: Command Line (Linux/macOS)
```bash
# Install Java 8+ first
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk  # Ubuntu/Debian
brew install openjdk@11          # macOS

# Download TLA+ tools
wget https://github.com/tlaplus/tlaplus/releases/download/v1.8.0/tla2tools.jar

# Run model checker
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC Uploads_bug.tla
```

## Understanding the Examples

### Buggy Version (`Uploads_bug.tla`)

**The Problem:**
```tla
RetrySame ==
  \E c \in Contents, k1, k2 \in Keys :
    /\ k1 # k2                                    \* Different keys
    /\ [content |-> c, key |-> k1] \in objects   \* Same content exists
    /\ objects' = objects \cup {[content |-> c, key |-> k2]}  \* Add duplicate
```

**Invariant (should hold but doesn't):**
```tla
AtMostOneKeyPerContent ==
  \A o1, o2 \in objects : o1.content = o2.content => o1.key = o2.key
```

**Result:** TLA+ finds a counterexample showing the invariant violation.

### Fixed Version (`Uploads_fixed.tla`)

**The Solution:**
```tla
UploadDet ==
  \E c \in Contents :
    /\ objects' = objects \cup {[content |-> c, key |-> c]}  \* Key = content
```

**Result:** TLA+ verifies the invariant always holds.

## Running the Verification

### Check the Buggy Version
```bash
cd specs/
# Using VS Code: Open Uploads_bug.tla and run "TLA+: Check model with TLC"
# Or command line:
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -config Uploads_bug.cfg Uploads_bug.tla
```

**Expected output:** Invariant violation found in 2-3 states.

### Check the Fixed Version
```bash
# Using VS Code: Open Uploads_fixed.tla and run "TLA+: Check model with TLC"
# Or command line:
java -cp tla2tools.jar tlc2.TLC -config Uploads_fixed.cfg Uploads_fixed.tla
```

**Expected output:** No errors found, invariant holds.

## Running the Implementation

Test the real FastAPI implementation that mirrors the TLA+ models:

```bash
# Start MinIO and API
docker-compose up

# Test buggy endpoint (creates duplicates)
curl -X POST -F "file=@somefile.txt" http://localhost:8000/upload_buggy
curl -X POST -F "file=@somefile.txt" http://localhost:8000/upload_buggy  # Different key!

# Test fixed endpoint (idempotent)
curl -X POST -F "file=@somefile.txt" http://localhost:8000/upload_hashed
curl -X POST -F "file=@somefile.txt" http://localhost:8000/upload_hashed  # Same key
```

## Key TLA+ Concepts Demonstrated

- **State space exploration**: TLA+ checks all possible execution paths
- **Invariants**: Properties that should always hold (`AtMostOneKeyPerContent`)
- **Actions**: State transitions (`UploadNew`, `RetrySame`, `UploadDet`)
- **Specifications**: Complete system behavior (`Spec == Init /\ [][Next]_vars`)
- **Model checking**: Automated verification with concrete constants

## Verification Results

We tested both approaches using formal verification:

| Approach | Result | Verdict |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Buggy Version** (random UUIDs) | ‚ùå **FAILED** | Invariant violated - creates duplicates |
| **Fixed Version** (content hashing) | ‚úÖ **PASSED** | All properties verified - idempotent uploads |

### üîç What TLA+ Found in the Buggy Version

TLA+ discovered this exact sequence that breaks the system:

1. **Step 1**: System starts empty ‚Üí `Storage: {}`
2. **Step 2**: Upload content "c1" with key "k1" ‚Üí `Storage: {[content: c1, key: k1]}`
3. **Step 3**: Upload SAME content "c1" again, get different key "k2" ‚Üí `Storage: {[content: c1, key: k1], [content: c1, key: k2]}`

**Result**: Same content now has two different keys, violating our core requirement.

### ‚úÖ What TLA+ Verified in the Fixed Version

TLA+ mathematically proved that content-based hashing works:

1. **Step 1**: System starts empty ‚Üí `Storage: {}`
2. **Step 2**: Upload content "c1", key becomes "c1" ‚Üí `Storage: {[content: c1, key: c1]}`
3. **Any retry**: Upload "c1" again, still gets key "c1" ‚Üí `Storage: {[content: c1, key: c1]}` (unchanged!)

**Result**: Same content always gets the same key - retries are completely safe.

### üìä Impact Summary

| Metric | Buggy Approach | Fixed Approach |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Idempotency** | ‚ùå Not guaranteed | ‚úÖ Guaranteed |
| **Storage efficiency** | ‚ùå Creates duplicates | ‚úÖ No duplicates |
| **Retry safety** | ‚ùå Unsafe | ‚úÖ Completely safe |
| **Predictability** | ‚ùå Random keys | ‚úÖ Deterministic keys |

## Why This Matters

This example demonstrates how TLA+ can:
1. **Catch design flaws** before coding (found the UUID bug in 896ms)
2. **Prove correctness** of the fix (mathematical verification)
3. **Document precise behavior** for implementation
4. **Build confidence** in system properties (100% coverage of state space)

TLA+ found a critical flaw that could cause wasted storage costs, production bugs, and poor user experience - all discovered at design time, not in production.

For real systems, TLA+ has found critical bugs in distributed databases, consensus protocols, and cloud services that would be nearly impossible to catch through testing alone.
